# Terminal Controller Restoration Plan

## Root Cause Analysis ✅

The terminal controller was working before because you had:
1. **Modified terminal-controller source** installed locally in your Python 3.10 environment
2. **Custom Git Bash integration** that bypassed the Python 3.11+ requirement
3. **Local installation** that has been lost/removed

## Current Issues
- ❌ Original `terminal-controller` package requires Python 3.11+
- ❌ Your environment is Python 3.10 (`nvdiffrast_py310`)
- ❌ Modified local installation is missing
- ❌ Wrappers can't find `terminal_controller` module

## Solution Strategy

### Option A: Restore Modified Installation (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Download terminal-controller source** from GitHub
2. **Apply the Git Bash modifications** (documented in your plans)
3. **Install modified version** locally in your Python 3.10 environment
4. **Test with existing wrappers**

### Option B: Standalone Implementation
1. **Create self-contained terminal controller** based on your wrappers
2. **Implement MCP protocol directly** without dependency
3. **Include Git Bash integration** natively

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Download & Modify Source (20 min)
1. Clone terminal-controller from GitHub
2. Apply documented Git Bash modifications
3. Ensure Python 3.10 compatibility

### Phase 2: Local Installation (10 min)
1. Install modified version in `nvdiffrast_py310`
2. Test `python -m terminal_controller`
3. Verify MCP protocol works

### Phase 3: Integration Testing (10 min)
1. Test with existing wrappers
2. Verify Cursor MCP auto-start
3. Confirm Git Bash functionality

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with Option A - restore the modified installation that was working before.
