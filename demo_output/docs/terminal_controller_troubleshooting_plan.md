# Terminal Controller MCP Troubleshooting Plan

## Current Status
- **MCP Server**: ✅ Connected and running
- **File Operations**: ✅ All working perfectly
- **Command Execution**: ❌ Always times out (subprocess issue)

## Test Results Summary
| Function | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| get_current_directory | ✅ Working | Returns C:\Users\rami |
| change_directory | ✅ Working | Successfully changes dirs |
| list_directory | ✅ Working | Lists contents properly |
| read_file | ✅ Working | Reads file content |
| write_file | ⚠️ Untested | Likely working |
| execute_command | ❌ BROKEN | Always times out |
| get_command_history | ❌ BROKEN | Empty (no commands succeed) |

## Diagnosis Steps

### Phase 1: Subprocess Investigation
1. **Check MCP server subprocess handling**
   - Review terminal_controller.py line ~35-50 (subprocess code)
   - Look for asyncio/subprocess compatibility issues
   - Check if Windows CMD shell is accessible

2. **Test direct subprocess execution**
   - Create test script outside MCP context
   - Test same subprocess.create_subprocess_shell calls
   - Verify Windows shell availability

3. **Check environment variables**
   - Verify COMSPEC points to cmd.exe
   - Check PATH includes system32
   - Test shell accessibility from Python

### Phase 2: MCP Framework Issues
1. **Check MCP server logs**
   - Look for subprocess timeout errors
   - Check for asyncio event loop issues
   - Verify MCP framework version compatibility

2. **Test alternative MCP configurations**
   - Try different timeout values
   - Test with different shell options
   - Check Windows-specific MCP server settings

### Phase 3: Workaround Solutions
1. **Hybrid approach optimization**
   - Use MCP for file operations only
   - Use regular terminal for command execution
   - Create automation scripts that combine both

2. **Alternative command execution**
   - Try different subprocess methods in source
   - Test direct shell calls vs subprocess
   - Explore MCP framework alternatives

## Root Cause Hypothesis
**Subprocess execution within MCP asyncio context has Windows-specific compatibility issues**, possibly related to:
- Windows shell access from Python asyncio
- MCP framework subprocess handling
- Event loop blocking on Windows subprocess calls

## Success Criteria
- ✅ File operations continue working
- ✅ execute_command works without timeout
- ✅ get_command_history shows executed commands

## Fallback Plan
If execute_command cannot be fixed:
- Use MCP for file automation (working perfectly)
- Use regular Git Bash terminal for commands
- Create helper scripts that bridge both systems
