# Terminal Controller MCP Installation Plan

## Overview
Install the Terminal Controller for MCP (Model Context Protocol) that enables secure terminal command execution through a standardized interface.

## Current State Analysis
- Existing workspace: nvdiffrast-trials project
- Python environment: `terminal_controller_env/` already exists (appears to be a venv)
- OS: Windows 11 (win32 10.0.26100)
- Shell: Git Bash/PowerShell

## Installation Options Analysis

### Option 1: PyPI Installation (RECOMMENDED)
**Pros**: 
- Official package from PyPI
- Clean, standard installation
- Easy to manage and update

**Command**: `pip install terminal-controller`

### Option 2: UV Installation
**Pros**: 
- Modern Python package manager
- Faster than pip
- Better dependency resolution

**Command**: `uv pip install terminal-controller`

### Option 3: From Source
**Pros**: 
- Latest development version
- Can modify if needed

**Steps**: Clone repo â†’ run setup script

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### Phase 1: Environment Setup (5 minutes)
1. **Check existing virtual environment**
   - Verify `terminal_controller_env/` is functional
   - Activate the environment
   - Check Python version (needs 3.11+)

### Phase 2: Installation (5 minutes)
1. **Install via PyPI** (simplest approach)
   ```bash
   pip install terminal-controller
   ```

2. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   python -m terminal_controller --help
   ```

### Phase 3: Configuration (10 minutes)
1. **Test standalone execution**
   ```bash
   python -m terminal_controller
   ```

2. **Document configuration for Claude Desktop/Cursor** 
   - Note: Configuration depends on MCP client being used
   - Provide example configurations

### Phase 4: Validation (5 minutes)
1. **Test basic functionality**
   - Verify MCP server starts
   - Test basic commands
   - Ensure security features work

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Terminal Controller installs without errors
- [ ] Can run `python -m terminal_controller` successfully
- [ ] Package responds to MCP protocol requests
- [ ] Security features (timeouts, blacklisting) are functional

## Rollback Plan
If installation fails:
1. Deactivate virtual environment
2. Delete installed packages: `pip uninstall terminal-controller`
3. Document errors for troubleshooting

## Time Estimate
**Total**: ~25 minutes
- Environment setup: 5 min
- Installation: 5 min  
- Configuration: 10 min
- Validation: 5 min

## Security Considerations
- Terminal Controller implements timeout controls
- Has blacklisting for dangerous commands
- Only provides access to user's current permissions
- Should be tested in isolated environment first

## Next Steps After Installation
1. Configure with MCP client (Claude Desktop/Cursor)
2. Test integration with coding workflows
3. Document usage patterns for development
